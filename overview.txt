 This is a Memory Card Game where the user flips over cards to find matching pairs. The game tracks time, score, and number of moves, and celebrates with an animation when the player wins.

1. HTML – Structure
The HTML lays out the structure of the game on the page.

🔹 Key Sections:
Title (<h1>)
Displays the game’s name: Memory Card Game.

Stats Section (<div class="stats">)
Shows real-time updates of:

Timer – how long the user has been playing.

Moves – how many times the player has flipped cards in total.

Score – how many successful matches the user has made.

Game Board (<div class="game-board">)
This is the main grid where the cards are rendered dynamically with JavaScript.

Restart Button
Allows the player to reset the game completely and start over.

2. CSS – Styling & Animation
The CSS makes the game visually appealing and responsive across devices.

🔹 What It Does:
Layout Styling
Centers the content, styles the board grid, and adds spacing and fonts.

Card Styling
Each card has two sides:

A front side (hidden face showing a ?)
A back side (reveals a symbol like ♥, ♠, 🌳, etc.)

Flip Animation
When a card is clicked, it rotates smoothly to reveal the back using a 3D transform.

Responsive Design
The game board adapts to various screen sizes, including phones and tablets.

Victory Celebration
When the user wins, a celebration message pops up, and animated confetti falls using CSS animations.

3. JavaScript – Logic & Interaction
JavaScript controls the behavior and logic of the game.

🔹 Game Setup:
Symbols Setup
Defines a list of unique symbols and duplicates them to form card pairs.

Shuffling
Randomizes card positions each time the game starts or is reset.

Card Creation
Dynamically generates the card elements and adds them to the board.

🔹 Game Logic:
Card Flip Handling

Tracks the first and second cards clicked.
Prevents more than two cards from flipping at once.
Compares the two flipped cards to check for a match.

Match Check & Score Update
If the symbols match, cards remain flipped and score increases.
If not, they flip back after a short delay.

Move Counter
Increments each time the user flips a second card in a turn.

Timer Functionality
Starts when the player flips their first card.
Increments every second and displays elapsed time.

🔹 Win Detection & Celebration:
When all pairs are matched:

The timer stops.

A “You Won” message appears on screen.
Confetti animation is triggered using DOM elements and CSS.

🔹 Restart Function:
Clears timer and score.
Resets board state and reshuffles cards.
